Client Design
=============

The client is written to be generated by the OpenApi generator
based on a swagger definition of the API itself.

There are some reasons to do this:

- Standardization, easily generate other clients in other languages without porting any code.
- Easy to maintain, writing a yaml definition of the API is much easier than maintaining potentially broken code going into the future.
- Built in documentation for the API, the swagger definition is a living document that can be used to generate documentation for the API.
- Finally, it's so much easier to write a client in yaml then generate the code.

Some of the downsides:

- The API itself provides filtering and that is rather complex and would be kind of a pain to implement inside of the swagger definition.
- Adding custom code can be done, but you do have to wrangle the openapi generator.

Based on the above positive points and negative points. I would argue that generating code especially in this case
would be the better choice over hand writing the client code. There are a lot of ways to bite yourself while writing a SDK
by hand and I would rather not do that and cause future issues. Another thing to keep in mind is that I believe that a SDK or client
does not contain business logic, there are exceptions, and is merely a method in which information can be retrieved and sent to the API.
